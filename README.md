# **Gabon Tree Exploration Project**

This folder contains the data and Jupyter Notebook scripts for analyzing TreeWatch data (Natkon dendrometer + sap flow sensor), combined with TOMST sensor data and phenological image data.


## FOLDER STRUCTURE 

Bush_climate_R_scripts/ -  R scripts by Bush et al. (2020)

scripts/                  -  Python decid package + Jupyter notebooks



## SUBFOLDERS DETAILS 

### Bush_climate_R_scripts 
Contains the R code and provided data in Bush_data/.

The R script Bush_climate_variables_writeout.R exports plotting data as CSVs for use in Python notebooks.

### data
contains all necessary data for running the scripts

### outputs
contains subfolders needed for writing out csv files and figures for further use

### scripts 
Contains the decid package and the jupyter notebooks:

- 1_data_cleanup.ipynb 		‚Äî data cleaning, detrending, smoothing
- 2_diameter_comparison.ipynb 	‚Äî resampling, aggregation, seasonal comparison, phenology event detection
- 3_diurnal_changes.ipynb 	‚Äî explore diurnal variations during leaf flush periods
- 4_climate.ipynb 		‚Äî load Bush climate data and reproduce graphs
- 5_water_relations.ipynb 	‚Äî hydraulic measures (TWD, DGR, MDS)
- 6_phenocam_data_animation.ipynb ‚Äî create and save MP4 animation of phenocam data
- 6_rain_and_flowering.ipynb	‚Äî identify rain events and bloom periods

## RUNNING THE PROJECT 

### üåê Option 1: Google Colab (Easiest)
1. Open Colab 
Go to colab.research.google.com

A. Run all notebooks
- Click File > Open notebook > GitHub
- Enter: runedeclercq/GabonTreeProject
- Select: scripts/0_SETUP_GOOGLE_COLAB.ipynb
- Run the Code Blocks
	- Step 4: Executes all notebooks in the folder, generating outputs and figures. These will appear in the Colab file browser under: GabonTreeProject > outputs
	- Step 2: Saves executed notebooks to your Google Drive under: GabonTreeProject > outputs

B. To Run the Notebooks Individually
- Open each notebook
- After setup (steps 1 & 3), open other notebooks via: File > Open notebook > GitHub in another tabblad, it's essential that the 0_SETUP_GOOGLE_COLAB.ipynb notebook stays open and running to access the repository and data
- To check wether the repository is open and accessible, you should see the GabonTreeProject folder with subfolders in the colab folder (on the left navigation pane).
- You can view code, outputs, and edit/run them freely.


‚ö†Ô∏è Colab sessions are isolated per tab. If your notebooks depend on outputs from previous ones, use %run to execute them sequentially in a single notebook, or run run_all.py (code block 4 in setup notebook).

### üíª Option 2: Local Setup (VS Code + Python)
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/runedeclercq/GabonTreeProject.git
2. Create a Virtual Environment
Example using .venv folder:
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements_local.txt
4. Run the Project
- Open notebooks in scripts/ folder and run them in order OR
- Run everything at once: python scripts/run_all.py
